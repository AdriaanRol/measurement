### gaussian esr dips in the PL
def fit_ESR_gauss(g_a, g_A, g_sigma, g_x0, *arg):
    """
    fitfunction for gaussian esr dips,
        y(x) = a - A*sum_i(exp(-((x-x0_i)/sigma)**2))

    Initial guesses (in this order):
        g_a : offset
        g_A : dip depth (all the same)
        g_sigma : std dev of the dip width (all the same)
        g_x0 : zero-point of the esr pattern
    
    For the splittings:
        an arbitrary amount of splits, in the form
        (m, g_s) : where m=multiplicity, g_s=initial guess for the
        splitting of two neighboring dips

    Example:
        giving (2, 2e3), (3, 2e3), would describe two splittings,
        e.g., the two-fold one for the zeeman splitting of the +/-1
        manifolds, and on top of that the 3-fold splitting of the N14.
        This results in 6 peaks in total, where 4 of them appear,
        because of the equal splitting in the two cases, on top
        of each other, yielding 2 low, and two deep dips.
